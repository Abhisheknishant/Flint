We design Flint to be portable.


== RHEL/CentOS 7

The default g++ package is too old to build Flint.
A workaround for the issue is to use the one provided by devtoolset-7.
Find instructions to install and use it in
<https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/>.

Then, install necessary tools for building and installing Flint with:
$ sudo yum install libtool cmake wget gtk3-devel sqlite-devel libuuid-devel \
    libxml2-devel patch


== Debian buster/bullseye/sid

We do not have a Debian package (.deb) for Flint yet.
Before building Flint, you will want to install prerequisite Debian packages
as follows:
$ sudo aptitude install gcc g++ autoconf automake libtool cmake \
    pkgconf libgtk-3-dev libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev patch


== Fedora 30

Use dnf(8) to install required packages for building Flint:
$ sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ autoconf automake libtool cmake make wget \
    sqlite-devel libuuid-devel libxml2-devel gtk3-devel patch


== Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)

$ sudo apt install g++ autoconf automake libtool cmake make libgtk-3-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev uuid-dev patch


== Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)

$ sudo apt install g++ autoconf automake libtool cmake libgtk2.0-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev uuid-dev patch
