This explains how to build and install core components of Flint.
See flint/INSTALL for its GUI part.


= Prerequisite

You need autotools for building Flint.
pkg-config is helpful but not required.

In order to build Flint, the following libraries are required:
- Boost 1.64.0
  http://www.boost.org/
- Ceres Solver 1.12
  http://ceres-solver.org/
- CZMQ 4.0.2
  http://czmq.zeromq.org/
- Protocol buffers 3.3.0
  https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
- The SBML ODE Solver Library (SOSlib) 1.9.0
  http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~raim/odeSolver/
  https://github.com/raim/SBML_odeSolver
- SUNDIALS 2.7.0
  http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials
- libxml 2.7.6 or higher
  http://xmlsoft.org/
- libSBML 3.4.1 or later
  http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
- clibsedml 0.1.2
  https://github.com/flintproject/clibsedml
- wxWidgets 3.1.0
  https://www.wxwidgets.org/
- ZeroMQ 4.2.2
  http://zeromq.org/

= How to build and install Flint

In short, type in your shell at the top of this source directory:
$ autoreconf -i -f
$ ./configure
$ make all
# make install
That's all if succeeded.

We recommend an out-of-tree way, e.g.:
$ autoreconf -i -f
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make all
# make install

Please specify --prefix if you want.
Give --with-boost option as follows if you have Boost installed at non-canonical
location, say, /opt:
$ ./configure --with-boost=/opt [...]
And --with-xml-prefix option accepts the prefix where libxml2 is installed, like:
$ ./configure --with-xml-prefix=/opt [...]
By default pkg-config searches Protocol Buffers. Providing environment variable
PKG_CONFIG_PATH allows you to suggest a non-canonical location of .pc scripts:
$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/lib/pkgconfig ./configure [...]
If you do not want to depend on pkg-config, environment variables PROTOBUF_CLFAGS
and PROTOBUF_LIBS help you with specifying arbitrary flags:
$ PROTOBUF_CFLAGS="-I/opt/include" PROTOBUF_LIBS='-L/opt/lib -lprotobuf' ./configure [...]
Note that, aside from the above, you may also have to tell the path of protoc
executable by --with-protoc option:
$ ./configure --with-protoc=/opt/bin/protoc [...]


== How to run tests

`make check` runs all of tests.
Boost Test Library is used for some of unit tests. For such a test case,
say test/base/test_rational, just run:
$ ./test/base/test_rational
