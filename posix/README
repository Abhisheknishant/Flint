Running make in this directory builds and installs Flint's programs as well as
required dependent libraries.
While by default "opt/" is used for the install destination directory, you can
assign another directory with Make variable PREFIX in config.mk.
It will try to download all of external libraries from Internet at first.
Note that installing ParMETIS requires cmake.
