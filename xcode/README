This directory contains packaging script for OS X version of Flint.
The script requires Xcode as well as autoconf, automake, libtool,
and pkg-config.

As a prerequisite, the dependent libraries have to be installed in a
directory before packaging.
Put config.mk in this directory in order to specify PKG_CONFIG Make
variable See config.mk.example for example.
Then running `make` will produce flint-*.dmg for all supported version
of OS X in case of success.
